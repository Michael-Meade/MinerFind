Once again, I found this sample on hybrid-analysis.com. The file named was ```1.sh```. 
## Killing The Competition
Like pretty much any other XMR linux based malware, the first thing this malware does is kill any processes that might be a competing miner. <br>

<br>
Next the script runs the c function. The first thing the c function does run this command. <br>
```chattr -i /usr/local/bin/dns /etc/cron.d/root /etc/cron.d/apache /var/spool/cron/root /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root /etc/ld.so.preload```
Next the script uses curl to download a bash script from ```hxxps://pastebin.com/raw/CnPtQ2tM```. The script downloads the file into the user's ```/usr/local/bin/dns``` directory. <br>
<br>

## Downloading of the Miner
The creator of the script registered the domain ```master.minerxmr.ru```. Which of course the creator used privacy setting when creating the domain.<br>
First the bash script checks if its the Linux machine is x64 or x86. If it is x64 or x86 the script then download the miner from ```hxxps://master.minerxmr.ru/1/1551434761x2728329064.jpg```
<br>
If the script detects otherwise than it downloads the x32 bit miner from ```https://master.minerxmr.ru/2/1551434778x2728329032.jpg```
Both versions of the mienr download to the machines ```/var/tmp/kworkerds``` directory.
