### Finding links in logs
To search for http links in today's Cowrie log. The writter used the following command. The command will open the ```cowrie.json``` file and search through the file using ```grep 'http'``.

```ruby
cat cowrie.json | grep 'http' 

```
Below are the results of the command beign ran. We get three resutls. All the results triggered the download eventid. So it's safe to say that the hacker tired to download a file onto the honeypot.

```ruby
{"eventid":"cowrie.session.file_download.failed","url":"http://aliyun.one)","message":"Attempt to download file(s) from URL (http://aliyun.one)) failed","sensor":"0b4427e4fa94","timestamp":"2019-12-02T22:20:13.192017Z","src_ip":"172.17.0.1","session":"33f4195a1e28"}
{"eventid":"cowrie.session.file_download.failed","url":"http://aliyun.one)","message":"Attempt to download file(s) from URL (http://aliyun.one)) failed","sensor":"0b4427e4fa94","timestamp":"2019-12-02T22:20:13.242504Z","src_ip":"172.17.0.1","session":"c2c28e5f5a43"}
{"eventid":"cowrie.session.file_download.failed","url":"http://aliyun.one)","message":"Attempt to download file(s) from URL (http://aliyun.one)) failed","sensor":"0b4427e4fa94","timestamp":"2019-12-02T22:20:13.245058Z","src_ip":"172.17.0.1","session":"92257240bbc3"}
```
All the results included the URL ```http://aliyun.one```.

Figure 1, shows the resutls of the whois lookup. Sadly the hacker was smart enought to protect the Registrant Contact.
