### The story
I was looking at my honey pot logs using the following command.
`cat cowrie.json* | jq '. | select(.eventid | contains("cowrie.session.file_download")) | .url' | grep -v "null" | sort | uniq -c | sort -bgr | head -n 10`
The command scrapes the log files and displays the top 10 URLS that were used to download files. 

Usually the top 10 contains IP's not domains. The last result caught my eye because it contained the domain name: http://chairfiller[.]org/smtp.

The first thing I did was the tool, Dirseach on the domain.
