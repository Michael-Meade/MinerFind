## About Monero

Monero is a privacy focused crypto currency. Unlike Bitcoins Monero's blockchain is hidden from the public in order to see the transcation the user needs the view key. 

Monero also incorpates ring signature. Ring singature takes a bunch of past transcations and combines them into a single signature. This signature is used to authorize the
transacation. With out it the blockchain will not process the transaction. The other members of the ring are all equal but used as decoys, this makes it impossible for anyone to 
see who is the real sender
Privacy is a tricky thing, on one everyone should want privacy but criminals or forgien goverment also abuse it. The North Korea goverment has been known to hack crypto currency exchanges in order to get around sancations that were placed on them. Privacy coins can be absued to fund terrorist activites
