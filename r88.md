### Counter measures used 

When I first downloaded the bash script from hybrid-analysis.com. I tired to download the bash script link on my Windows machine. But ```http://e3sas6tzvehwgpak.tk/r88.sh``` gave me a redirect error. <br>

But when I typed the command,  ```curl http://e3sas6tzvehwgpak.tk/r88.sh``` on my subsystem I was able to download the link.<br>
