### About 

A tool that allows the users to get the latest cyber news. It stores all the news sites in a JSON format. Which makes it easy to add or remove a site. 
I also included a script that makes allows users to implment the project into a dicord chat bot. The script also uses embeds to make it prettier.


### Installing the gems that are needed

```ruby
gem install metainspector

gem install nokogiri

gem install discordrb```


### News list

The project also allows its users to show the list of news sites in different formants. It supports JSON and plain.
