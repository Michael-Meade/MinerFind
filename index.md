I was searching through hybrid-analysis.com and I stumbled on to a bash script that looked like its used for deploying mining scripts on Linux machines. From looking at the file, it looks like that it's job is to download a couple of other scripts that will download a bunch of other scripts.<br>
<br>

From what I understand from Bash, the script creates a function called ```Check()``` that will download the other files. Check() has two argurments, I labled the arguments <font color="red"><b>1</b></font> and <font color="blue"><b>2</b></font>. The first argument <font color="red"><b>1,</b></font> is the url where the scritp is hosted. The second argument <font color="blue"><b>2,</b></font> is the where it wil download the script to on the victims machine. 
<br><br>
The first file that the scripts downloads is: ```http://132.148.148.79/plus/kok```

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
